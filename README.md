The dataset can be downlaod from: 

1- For Multi-PIE, the face data was downloaded from the TP-GAN GitHub repository at: https://github.com/HRLTY/TP-GAN. 

2- CAS-PEAL face data was downloaded from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/YuYin1/DA-GAN. 

3- Finally, the FEI dataset was downloaded from the official repository of the FEI: https://fei.edu.br/~cet/facedatabase.html.

Due to a lack of access to the original dataset, a generated image was used for Multi-PIE, and other datasets were downloaded from the links above.  

Official TP-GAN Tensorflow implementation can be found at: https://github.com/HRLTY/TP-GAN
