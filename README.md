The dataset can be downlaod from: 

For Multi-PIE, the face data was downloaded from the TP-GAN GitHub repository at: \url{https://github.com/HRLTY/TP-GAN}. 

CAS-PEAL face data was downloaded from the GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/YuYin1/DA-GAN}. 

Finally, the FEI dataset was downloaded from the official repository of the FEI: \url{https://fei.edu.br/~cet/facedatabase.html}.

Due to a lack of access to the original dataset, a generated image was used for Multi-PIE, and other datasets were downloaded from the links above.
